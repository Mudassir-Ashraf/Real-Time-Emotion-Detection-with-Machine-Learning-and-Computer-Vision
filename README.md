# Real-Time-Emotion-Detection-with-Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to perform real-time facial emotion detection. 
Trained on the FER-2013 dataset, the model classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. 
The system integrates Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV for live webcam-based emotion recognition, applying data augmentation, 
feature extraction, and real-time processing to improve accuracy. Future improvements include expanding emotion categories, 
enhancing dataset diversity, and optimizing deployment for mobile devices
